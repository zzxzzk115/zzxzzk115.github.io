  abstract = {A remote-control mobile video surveillance system is designed to expand the video monitoring range and enhance flexibility of a single camera. The system is composed of four modules. The smart car based on the Arduino system is equipped with a camera to receive user instructions for collecting videos. The embedded Linux system makes real-time acquisition of video data feasible through the V4L2 interface. Meanwhile, it sends the data to the forwarding server through the network and forwards the control commands from users to the smart car. The server ransmits the video to the client while the user control instructions to the Linux system. Additionally, Android-based mobile terminal presents monitoring videos and provides a user control interface. Compared with the existing system, the new system enables monitoring without blind spots by a single camera.},
